## Data Structures and Algorithms Project

Collection of my solutions to various Data Structure and Algorithm problems. Each file is a particular data structure or algorithm written in Python with comment explanations describing the processes taken.

This was done in conjunction with a Data Structures and Algorithm course for the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) co-created by Amazon Web Services, GitHub, AT&T and Google.
